## SuperTicTac

A lot more to do, I wasnt able to complete in the 7 days

Things to do (almost everything)

- make it two player only (more people can watch but only two can interact) **Hard**
- ~~finish the move logic (activating and deactivating cells)  you should only be able to play in the highlighted cells~~
- implement the game logic (the basics are already there in Game.rb and Board.rb)
- Add login and stat tracking capabilities
- Add powerups
- Add AI

Probably a lot more to do

Rules of the game are when you place a mark in a cell that highlights the quadrant the player has to play in next you can not play anywhere. 
To win the game you need to win 3 of the smaller games in a row, so its more strategy and technical thinking than basic tictac

Its better playing against a human opponent rather than ai
