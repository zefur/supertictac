## SuperTicTac


Things to do (almost everything)

- ~~make it two player only (more people can watch but only two can interact)
- ~~finish the move logic (activating and deactivating cells) you should only be able to play in the highlighted cells~~
- ~~implement the game logic (the basics are already there in Game.rb and Board.rb)~~
- ~~Add stupid Ai~~
- Chat functionality
- STYLING
- Chat capabilities 
- Add login and profile pages(implemented basic)
- Stat tracking capabilities(wins and losses implemented)
- Add powerups(on hold)
- Add smart AI(on hold)
- Make it pretty(see above)
- Allow the destruction of rooms(guest's rooms /should/ delete on log out)
- Allow for options in the room build method(

Probably a lot more to do

Rules of the game are when you place a mark in a cell that highlights the quadrant the player has to play in next you can not play anywhere.
To win the game you need to win 3 of the smaller games in a row, so its more strategy and technical thinking than basic tictac

Its better playing against a human opponent rather than ai
